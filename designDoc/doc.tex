\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this document is to provide for a critical analysis on the available technologies that can be used on our project.
Some of our technologies have already been decided for us, however they are still subject to critical review and comparison.
Everything will be compared in sets of three, comparing our current selection with two competing choices.
We will review the technical details of why our preferred technology is chosen, and what benefits and disadvantages come along with it.
In the end this assignment was able to help the group solidify and reconsider some of the choices we had in mind.
Moving forward we can be a lot more confident in what we have to chosen to use to accomplish the task.
