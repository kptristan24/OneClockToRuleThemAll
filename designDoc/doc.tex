\title{One Clock To Rule Them All}
\author{Tristan Hari, Tasman Thenell, and Scott Metzsch}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this document is to provide for a critical analysis on the available technologies that can be used on our project.
Some of our technologies have already been decided for us, however they are still subject to critical review and comparison.
Everything will be compared in sets of three, comparing our current selection with two competing choices.
We will review the technical details of why our preferred technology is chosen, and what benefits and disadvantages come along with it.
In the end this assignment was able to help the group solidify and reconsider some of the choices we had in mind.
Moving forward we can be a lot more confident in what we have to chosen to use to accomplish the task.

\section{Scope}
The product will improve the day to day clock viewing experience of the average clock user.
It will be fashionable and affordable as an alternative to other similar products on the market.

\section{Purpose and Background}
The intention of this document is to breakdown the details of this project, including the steps we will take to complete it and the tools/methods we will use to effectively develop our product.
The metrics that we will use to measure product completion will also be included in this document, and will be referenced as we continue to develop throughout the year.
The background of the product arises from the personal interest of our client, Victor Hsu.
There are similar products on the market, such as QWLock by Ziegert and Funk, however the problem arises with the price and availability of such things.
They are considered designer items and thusly very expensive.
It is also difficult to track down a model that uses english lettering, as their primary customer base is in Germany.
There are plenty of DIY projects online that also approach this problem, however they are often very complicated and considered outside the typical users ability to accomplish.
The intention of this product is that it will be much cheaper and easier to replicate than the current instructables.
