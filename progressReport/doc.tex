\title{One Clock To Rule Them All - Progress Report}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this document is to discuss the progress of the project and what our team has done during the fall term.
There will be a explanation of each document we wrote and a summary of what we did during each week of the term.

\section{Project Purposes and Goals}
For the fall term there were many documents to write that will help to layout and define what we will be working on during the winter and spring terms next year.
Some of these documents will have changes made to them as we better understand out project, but the final product and goal will stay the same. 
\subsection{Problem Statement}
The first of these documents to be written was the Problem Statement. 
In this document we were working to create a definition and description of what our research will be based around for the rest of the year. 
\subsection{Requirements Document}
The next document we wrote was the Requirements Document.
In this document we were tasked with outlining the project so that both us and our client are clear on what the end product will be.
This document is important because it will serve as a list to create user stories and as a road map of sorts on when we expect to have certain feature completed by. 
\subsection{Technology Review}
The next document assigned was the Technology Review. 
For this document many groups would research possible solutions to their requirements and then choose which one was best suited for the task. 
But out project differed from most for this document, mainly because 3 of our main features were chosen for us by our project owner Victor.
The microcontroller, RTC, and LEDs that make up the main components of our clock were supplied by Victor.
So instead of finding which products to use for our clock, we wrote a comparison of alternative components to look into the quality of Victor's decisions. 
\subsection{Design Document}
The final document, besides this one, that we wrote for the term was the Design Document.
In this we document we created a road map for the rest of the year. 
The details of this map may change, but the big pictures and final destination will stay the same.

\section{Current Stage of Project}
Currently in our project we are at a point where we are ready to start coding and designing features for the clock.
We have the main 3 components, the microcontroller, LEDs, and RTC, and now are starting the process of learning to connect them and communicate between the components.
