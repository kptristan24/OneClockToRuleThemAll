Included is an explanation of each document written during the design period and a summary of the progress made during each week of the term.
In addition, this process is reflected in retrospective which discusses challenges and difficulties as well as progress.

\section{Project Purpose and Goals}
The purpose of the project is to build a set of open clock control software for the purpose of driving a letter display or BCD
For the fall term there were many documents to write that will help to layout and define what we will be working on during the winter and spring terms next year.
Most of these documents will undergo revisions to make them better as we begin to better understand our project.
That being said, the final product and goal are a fixed target, not including stretch goals, and are unlikely to change.
\subsection{Problem Statement}
The problem statement was the first formal piece of writing to put the project onto paper.
In this document we were working to create a definition and description of what our research and work will be based around for the rest of the year.
By the end of the year, the problem described in this document is what we are seeking to solve.
For our project, the problem being solved was making an affordable word clock that is friendly towards user modification.
\subsection{Requirements Document}
Once we had a better understanding of the specifics of the problem, a set of requirements were developed to guide the project.
In this document we were tasked with outlining the project so that both us and our client are clear on what the end product will be.
This document is important because it will serve as a list to create user stories and as a road map of sorts on when we expect to have certain feature completed by.
\subsection{Technology Review}
After developing a set of requirements, it became clear that there were many aspects of the project would require additional information outside of what we started the project with.
In order to rectify these deficiencies, we selected nine important components from the project and took them through a technology review process.
For this document many groups would research possible solutions to their requirements and then choose which one was best suited for the task.
But out project differed from most for this document, mainly because 3 of our main features were chosen for us by our project owner Victor.
The microcontroller, RTC, and LEDs that make up the main components of our clock were supplied by Victor.
So instead of finding which products to use for our clock, we wrote a comparison of alternative components to look into the quality of Victor's decisions.
\subsection{Design Document}
The final technical document that was created this term was the Design Document.
In this we document we created a road map for development for the rest of the year.
The details of this map may change, but the big pictures and final destination will stay the same.

\section{Current Stage of Project}
From our fall progress report to now we have made some major progress in getting closer to having our clock ready for expo in May. 
Currently we have all the major components talking that would inhibit working on code.
We have the RTC communicating with the board and can set the time and display it in the serial monitor. 
The LEDs are connected and correctly lighting up thanks to the libraries we found the connect them. 
Getting the LEDs and RTC to connect and work was quite easy after moving to the new Arduino board since there are thousands of libraries that we can download and implement. 
The change of the board has really increased our productivity and ability to move forward. 

Looking forward we still have a bit to work on but most of the work is centered around designing and manufacturing the case for the clock.
We still need to design the word layout for the clock face itself, but there are some algorithms and tools and we have found online to use. 
Designing some demos for the expo event are also on our to do list. 
These demos will show control of color, brightness, different time display modes, and possibly games such as snake. 

\section{Problems and Solutions}
The main problems that we have run into right now is learning the hardware side of our project.
We have not researched the ways to connect all the hardware to the microcontroller, but have started to figure this out from experimentation and documentation.
Once we figure out how to connect everything, writing all the code for the clock should come quickly since it is in C and everybody on the team has relevant coding and embedded experience.
Another problem we have had is time management on writing and planning out the documents outlined in the Project Purposes and Goals section.
The main reason for our time management issues was that it usually took awhile for us to understand exactly what the assignment description was asking for.
We found the assignment descriptions a little vague at times and we had to contact our TA or a professor to fully understand assignments.
Meetings with our TA Jon Dodge were useful all term since we were able to ask questions and get a better understand of a document by asking him questions.

\section{Interesting Pieces of Code}
At this point of our project we have not written much code ourselves, but there are many hello world and demo programs that you can download for free on the MPLAB website.
These basic programs will help us to learn the basics of how to interact and control different parts of the board.
Also the online IDE for the microcontroller is similar to Eclipse in layout and has a user friendly interface.
To have version control for our code we will need to download the MPLAB IDE so that we can push and pull from git easier.

\section{Weekly Update Summaries}
\subsection{Week 1}
This week we mostly just got our bearings back on the status of the project and with our client, and prepared for the term.
We did not have much in terms of significance for the project progress.

\subsection{Week 2}
This week we got very back into fast pace development and we discovered something of major significance for the project.
After spending hours verifying a researching alternatives, we decided at this point that we needed to use a more friendly microcontroller.
We went to approach Victor with the KeyeStudio Uno, and see what he thinks.

\subsection{Week 3}
This week was excellent in terms of progress.
We got our new board, and we successfully got accurate time readings from the RTC reading to the serial monitor!
This is huge as is basically verifies the biggest part of the clocks functionality.

\subsection{Week 4}
This week we found several awesome RTC and LED libraries, that led to huge bounds in project progress.
We basically spent some time discovering functions and how we're going to use them.
We also got basic LED lights going.

\subsection{Week 5}
This week we met again with Victor and discussed the rest of the products that needed to be purchased for the completion of the product.
We settled buttons, powering, wiring, and LED details.
