Included is an explanation of each document written during the design period and a summary of the progress made during each week of the term.
In addition, this process is reflected in retrospective which discusses challenges and difficulties as well as progress.

\section{Project Purpose and Goals}
The purpose of the project is to build a set of open clock control software for the purpose of driving a letter display or BCD
In addition to this, a clock housing will be developed with a clock face which satisfies the goals of legibility and flexibility.
Other goals include providing the final product at a price more reasonable than the thousand dollar asking price while stilling keeping a certain quality to the appearance.

\section{Document Updates}
With half a term of additional development time, the project has moved forward towards an alpha state.
To reflect changes that occured over the course of developing the alpha, another round updates to documentation have occred.
These changes are reflected soley in the tech review and design document.
The changes made to these documents are outlined below.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The problem statement was the first formal piece of writing to put the project onto paper.
In this document we were working to create a definition and description of what our research and work will be based around for the rest of the year.
By the end of the year, the problem described in this document is what we are seeking to solve.
For our project, the problem being solved was making an affordable word clock that is friendly towards user modification.

\subsection{Technology Review}
The technology review has been updated to reflect several changes in the project that have occured over the past two months.
The largest changes take the form of a change in the development board.
While the MPLABS Xpress board seemed like a good idea on paper, it didn't have much in the way of software support.
In addition to this, the documentation and code examples for the board were ranging from poor to nonexistant.

The new board chosen to replace it is an Arduino Uno.
This board has better software support and documentation by a very large margin.
This is documented in the Technology Review in the form of discussing the new board as well as the libraries that come with it.
Extensive research into libraries allowed development to progress more in two weeks than it had duing the six weeks prior.

\subsection{Design Document}
The Design Document has been updated to reflect changing technology and hardware choices.
The largest changes were made to the developer support section.
With the change to an easier and more well documented board, development stays relatively similar but with more options.
In addition to this, the new board has more memory which allows developers additional freedom to change and add features.

\section{Current Stage of Project}
From our fall progress report to now we have made some major progress in getting closer to having our clock ready for expo in May.
Currently we have all the major components talking that would inhibit working on code.
We have the RTC communicating with the board and can set the time and display it in the serial monitor.
The LEDs are connected and correctly lighting up thanks to the libraries we found the connect them.
Getting the LEDs and RTC to connect and work was quite easy after moving to the new Arduino board since there are thousands of libraries that we can download and implement.
The change of the board has really increased our productivity and ability to move forward.

Looking forward we still have a bit to work on but most of the work is centered around designing and manufacturing the case for the clock.
We still need to design the word layout for the clock face itself, but there are some algorithms and tools and we have found online to use.
Designing some demos for the expo event are also on our to do list.
These demos will show control of color, brightness, different time display modes, and possibly games such as snake.

\section{Problems and Solutions}
The main problems that we have run into right now is learning the hardware side of our project.
We have not researched the ways to connect all the hardware to the microcontroller, but have started to figure this out from experimentation and documentation.
Once we figure out how to connect everything, writing all the code for the clock should come quickly since it is in C and everybody on the team has relevant coding and embedded experience.
Another problem we have had is time management on writing and planning out the documents outlined in the Project Purposes and Goals section.
The main reason for our time management issues was that it usually took awhile for us to understand exactly what the assignment description was asking for.
We found the assignment descriptions a little vague at times and we had to contact our TA or a professor to fully understand assignments.
Meetings with our TA Jon Dodge were useful all term since we were able to ask questions and get a better understand of a document by asking him questions.

\section{Interesting Pieces of Code}
There are several awesome things that have pushed the project forward at an amazing rate.
First of all, we found an amazing library for interaction with the RTC from Dreamspark.
The library is compatible with our model RTC and contains extremely helpful functions such as RTC.Hour(), and RTC.Minute().
Having an RTC library this powerful is extremely useful and makes the idea of adding more flush features a reality.
We also found an awesome LED control library Adafruit.star.h, which has tonnes of documentation online and very powerful tools within it.
With it, we were very quickly able to generate a simple binary clock to test the library and the RTC reads in tandom.
It is very interesting.

\section{Weekly Update Summaries}
\subsection{Week 1}
This week we mostly just got our bearings back on the status of the project and with our client, and prepared for the term.
We did not have much in terms of significance for the project progress.

\subsection{Week 2}
This week we got very back into fast pace development and we discovered something of major significance for the project.
After spending hours verifying a researching alternatives, we decided at this point that we needed to use a more friendly microcontroller.
We went to approach Victor with the KeyeStudio Uno, and see what he thinks.

\subsection{Week 3}
This week was excellent in terms of progress.
We got our new board, and we successfully got accurate time readings from the RTC reading to the serial monitor!
This is huge as is basically verifies the biggest part of the clocks functionality.

\subsection{Week 4}
This week we found several awesome RTC and LED libraries, that led to huge bounds in project progress.
We basically spent some time discovering functions and how we're going to use them.
We also got basic LED lights going.

\subsection{Week 5}
This week we met again with Victor and discussed the rest of the products that needed to be purchased for the completion of the product.
We settled buttons, powering, wiring, and LED details.
